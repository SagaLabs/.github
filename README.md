## Open-Source Philosophy and Closed-Source Approach

At SagaLabs, much of our technology is **closed-source**, and there are a few important reasons for this:

- **Monetary Value**: As a business, some aspects of our technology are our competitive edge. Our custom-built cyber ranges, training modules, and internal tools hold substantial **monetary value**, and we need to protect the specifics of this intellectual property.
  
- **Security Concerns**: Currently, our platform is in the **alpha stage**, and we're not fully confident that our secure coding practices are ready for public scrutiny. Until we have thoroughly vetted our platform’s security, we are keeping the codebase private to avoid potential exploits or vulnerabilities.

- **Transparency in Infrastructure**: While we keep the core platform closed, we are very open about our **infrastructure setups**. We enjoy sharing our approach to **deployment, scaling, and cybersecurity infrastructure** and often provide **code examples** on how we set up these systems. This transparency aligns with our desire to contribute to the community and educate others in the cybersecurity space.

We plan to contribute more to the open-source community once we are more confident in the security and maturity of our platform.

## Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability in our systems, we encourage responsible disclosure. Please send an email with details of the issue to:

📧 **[contact@sagalabs.dk](mailto:contact@sagalabs.dk)**

We will work with you to understand the issue, verify its impact, and address it as quickly as possible. Thank you for helping us maintain the security of our platform.
